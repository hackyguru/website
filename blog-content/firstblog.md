## Discovering a World Beyond Comfort

As the world began to recover from the pandemic, I felt an irresistible urge to explore. Until then, my life had revolved around a safe, familiar circle that rarely allowed for spontaneous decisions. Even when I knew something was right, I'd go through a lengthy process just to feel more confident. Ironically, this lack of spontaneity was one of my sources of security.

Everything changed when I boarded that first flight to Thailand for a company trip. Like many in traditional households, my parents were concerned about my safety, judgment and the reputation of Bangkok's nightlife. But my newfound financial independence helped convince both them and myself that this was a journey worth taking.

I deliberately chose to spend one night alone in Bangkok before joining my colleagues. While they stayed in a luxury hotel, I opted for a modest $15-a-night accommodation in a quiet alley. That rainy night remains vivid in my memory – it was the first time I had ever stayed alone in a hotel, marking my first true taste of independence.

## The Thrill of the Unexpected

My journey continued to Koh Samui in Thailand's Surat Thani province. It was here, during the company retreat, that I experienced many firsts, including my first cocktail and the excitement of exploring on my own.

A defining moment came during a five-hour jet ski tour around the island. Overwhelmed midway, I asked to be dropped off on a remote shore with no public transport and limited connectivity. Armed with just 1000 baht and wearing only wet swim shorts, I navigated my way back to the hotel through a mix of resourcefulness and luck. This adventure awakened in me a love for the unpredictable nature of life.

This experience introduced me to the exhilarating world of uncertainty. I began to relish the joy of unplanned adventures, no longer meticulously planning my trips. Over the next few years, I visited 31 countries, each journey strengthening my independence and adaptability.

Travel taught me far more than my university degree ever could.

## Learning to Let Go

Travel for me is a mix of emotions: 10% joy, 10% sadness and 80% learning. One of its greatest lessons is learning to let go – of things, situations and even people. I've witnessed breathtaking sights and met extraordinary individuals, creating cherished memories along the way.

While I treasure these connections, I'm still mastering the art of letting go. Perhaps the purpose isn't to make it easier each time, but to feel the full weight of each experience, allowing us to form unique bonds with people, places and moments.

Over time, I've realized that my purpose isn't to be a free bird, but rather a welcoming space – a metaphorical cage – seeking meaningful connections. This 'bird' could be a person, a place, or anything that leaves a lasting impression.

At this stage of my life, I value memories above material possessions. I see myself as a collector of experiences, gathering precious moments wherever I go. Sometimes, I feel guilty about holding onto memories that might be better forgotten – like a fight in Greece or being mugged in Nairobi. But part of me believes that even these challenging experiences are worth remembering, as they've shaped who I am today.

## Welcoming New Chapters

For two years, I reveled in the beauty of an unplanned life and I intend to keep that spirit alive. However, in an unexpected turn of events, I recently moved to London to pursue my master's degree at University College London.

This move has made me realize that my period of instability, while enriching, may have caused me to lose some discipline. The intense focus I had before my travels has been replaced by a mind more easily distracted by new influences. But there's a silver lining – I feel like I'm finally living a complete life on my own terms.

For the first time, I feel like I have bigger responsibilties in building a home, take care of my indoor plants to nurture and I'm building a social circle in a new city. I'm cooking my own meals and taking care of household chores – a significant change from the more sheltered life I led back home. This transition has pushed me to manage my own mental health and daily responsibilities in ways I never had to before.

If I could have written my own story before I was born, I would have definitely included this exciting chapter. The potential for personal growth and new connections fills me with anticipation. As part of this documenting journey, I've launched this personal portfolio website to document and reflect on my experiences. I can't wait to see what lies ahead and I hope that you can someday experience the luxury of unstability soon!
